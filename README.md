# Appreciation-Bot
Generates random nice tweets.



## How to run the program
To get the program going, download the latest release and change your "CONSUMER_KEY", "CONSUMER_SECRET", "ACCESS_TOKEN" and "ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET" in the source code. You can get them at [the Twitter-apps page](https://apps.twitter.com/).

You'll also need [Tweetinvi](https://github.com/linvi/tweetinvi). You can install it via NuGet in Visual Studio.

You can use the task scheduler from Windows, to generate tweets on a regular basis.
